1.EDA(Exploring Data Analysis):
First, we look at the data to understand it.

We check:
How many rows & columns?
What type of data is there?
Any Patterns?
2. OLAP Analysis:
We analyze data from different perspectives.

Example:
Which warehouse causes delays?
Which shipment mode is fastest?
Which products arrive late?

3.Data Cleaning:
Fix messy or incorrect data.

We:
remove duplicates
fix wrong values
correct spelling issues

4.Handling Missing Values:

Sometimes data is empty.

We can:
fill with average values
replace with “Unknown”
remove if needed

5.Outlier Detection:
Find unusual values.


6.Features Scaling:
Make numbers comparable.

7.Skewness Analysis:

Check if data is uneven.
If most values are small but few are huge → skewed.

8.Feature Encoding:
Convert words into numbers.

For Example:
Male -> 0
Female -> 1
Flight -> column

9.Data Transformation:

Change data to make it better.

10.Dimensionality Reduction:
Reduce number of columns.

11.Feature Selection:
Keep only important columns.
Removes:
useless data
repeated info

12.Statistical Analysis:
Understand data using numbers.
We study:
average
variation
relationships

13.Data Visualization:
Show data using charts.
Examples:
bar chart
histogram


14.Pipeline Architecture:
Automates all steps.
